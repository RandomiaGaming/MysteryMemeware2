EZProgram allows you to easily create a Window and Renderer from WindowSettings and RendererSettings.
Additionally it makes sets just a few settings to make sure you aren't dumb.
And sets up custom callbacks for WndProc and Draw. So you don't need to worry about silly stuff.
Sets up a profiler for you as well.
Manages multiple threads.

When used EZProgram sets up a window based on your WindowSettings.
Sets up a renderer based on your RendererSettings.
Starts both of them running/showing on seprate threads.
Customizes your WndProc function to include resizing logic.
Sets up a profiler to tick every frame.
Sets up callbacks to Draw function to be ran every frame on the renderer.

Still not sure if this should be a function or a class. Probably a function TBH.
